## 🔭 The Realms of Interest

👀 My interests span the realms of:

* Pipelines/CI/DevOps (because automating tedious tasks is my religion)
* AI (trying to teach machines to be less annoying than humans)
* Python (the duct tape of the digital world)
* C# (when you absolutely, positively need to write enterprise-grade spaghetti code)
* ReactJS/TypeScript (because everyone loves debugging asynchronous JavaScript promises, right?)

---

## 🤝 The Quest for Collaboration

💞 Seeking collaborations on:

* Free licensed projects (where we can argue about coding standards and semicolons)

## 📬 The Digital Ether

📫 Reach me in the digital ether:

* Telegram: [https://t.me/F33liXx](https://t.me/F33liXx) (prepare for cryptic memes and existential dread)

## 👾 The Bonus Geeky Content

## 🧠 The Mind's Debugging Ritual

* **Preferred Debugging Method:** Staring intensely at the code until it confesses its sins.

## ♾️ The Infinite Structure

* **Favorite Data Structure:** The infinite loop (it's very inclusive).

## 🐧 The System of Choice

* **Operating System of Choice:** Arch Linux (because why have a stable system when you can have endless configuration headaches?).

## 🧙‍♂️ The Terminal Tool

* **Terminal Emulator:** Vim (because why use a text editor when you can have a modal text editor that makes you feel like a wizard?).

## ❓ The Current State

* **Current Mood:** 404 - Sanity Not Found.

## 📜 The Daily Proclamation

* **Quote of the Day:** "There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who complain about JavaScript."
