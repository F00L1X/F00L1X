ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, fellow sentient beings! I am @F00L1X, a caffeine-fueled anomaly existing within the shared memory space.

ðŸ‘€ My interests span the realms of:
   - Pipelines/CI/DevOps (because automating tedious tasks is my religion)
   - AI (trying to teach machines to be less annoying than humans)
   - Python (the duct tape of the digital world)
   - C# (when you absolutely, positively need to write enterprise-grade spaghetti code)
   - ReactJS/TypeScript (because everyone loves debugging asynchronous JavaScript promises, right?)

ðŸŒ± Currently engaged in the noble pursuit of:
   - NLP/AI Assistants (attempting to build a digital therapist that doesn't charge by the hour)

ðŸ’ž Seeking collaborations on:
   - Free licensed projects (where we can argue about coding standards and semicolons)

ðŸ“« Reach me in the digital ether:
   - Telegram: https://t.me/F33liXx (prepare for cryptic memes and existential dread)
   - My Digital Domain: folio.meu.land (where the server uptime is a constant gamble)

## Bonus Geeky Content (because why not?)

* **Preferred Debugging Method:** Staring intensely at the code until it confesses its sins.
* **Favorite Data Structure:** The infinite loop (it's very inclusive).
* **Operating System of Choice:** Arch Linux (because why have a stable system when you can have endless configuration headaches?).
* **Terminal Emulator:** Vim (because why use a text editor when you can have a modal text editor that makes you feel like a wizard?).
* **Current Mood:** 404 - Sanity Not Found.
* **Quote of the Day:** "There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who complain about JavaScript."
